      <p>Hello, My name is Midah Boitshepo. I am from a  landlocked country called Botswana 
        located in the southern part of Africa. I am married to my wonderful husband and we are blessed with three children, 
        two girls and a boy. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since 2011. I currently 
        work as a Technical Manager in the Banking Sector. My goal is to have my own Information Technology Consulting company,
         where I will use my expert knowledge in IT to provide technical services like website development and app development to customers. 
         I am currently a Software Developmet student at Brigham Young University. I have a first degree in Business Systems, however one may wonder 
         why I am doing another degree in Software Development. Well we are living in a world where technology is rapidly changing and new ways of doing things 
         are being introduced to the IT Industry. For us to be always future ready to accomodate these changes we need to keep up with these changes to remain relevant.
        What I have learnt ten years ago is no longer applicable now. I need to upskill and re-skill myself to ensure I deliver services that are relevant and up to the current standards. </p>
